# Flight of Concord

This is a React arcade game where you must change the color of enemies to allow
yourself to fly through them. If your ship matches the enemy's color, you can
fly past it, and whenever you do, the number of ships of that same color will
be added to your point total.

This game was made by [Brent P. Newhall](http://brentnewhall.com) as part of
[Brent's Game a Week Challenge](https://s3.amazonaws.com/brents-portfolio/index.html)
